### Hi there üçì 

I'm Valerie, a Computer Scientist from Germany, living in Switzerland.  
I recently completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Media, now I'm working as a junior developer in Z√ºrich.   
I love coding, baking, swimming, climbing and ... actually a lot more. Currently just enjoying living in Switzerland.
